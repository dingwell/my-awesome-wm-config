This is a customized version of the Zenburn theme.

Zenburn was originally written for Vim by Jani Nurminen:
http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/

The theme has later been adapted for other applications by Adrian C.:
http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/j/articles/zenburn/index.html

My version is basically the same as Adrians but the config file has been 
modified to work better with my rc.lua-file.
